    This would be the proof or Whatever

    ## Claim 1

    ## Claim 2


%def:
def(semigroup):Monoid 
    this is a definition

    -) item 1 This is in item 1
    -) item 2
        This is item 2 as well
        ok we can just keep going da pythin stunff
        yesssir yummy
    This is not in item 2
    -) haha

    1) This is item 1
    2) This is 2
        This is two as well
    3) This is three
    This is not three
    4) This is four

    neq: // niceeq
        \frac{1}{2} * \R
    
    eq: // regular equation
        \frac{1}{3}


    \ref{haha}
        


exp(experience the moneky zone):
    this is an example
    new line is here
    
// \ref{1.1/group} renders as "<a href="1.1/group">group</a>"


in groups1 we defined a notion of a group, but we also defined a notion of a group in 1.2. If we highlight over either of these words group, 
we would see a list saying something like:
    -) groups1:group
    -) groups2:group


If we wish to not have a reference for something like set and set exists in the current context, then instead of writing set, we should write
\noref{set}.

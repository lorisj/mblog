intro:
    This note covers chapter 1 section 1 in Larry C. Grove's book Algebra, as well as other things that I have added.



// everytime we see the phrase "semigroup", we should link to this block.
%def:semigroup
def:Semigroup
    A semigroup $\mathcal G = (G,*)$ is a $\mathcal L_g (= \{*(\cdot, \cdot)\})$-structure such that $*$ is associative.



// Putting another link in the () means that the property is tied to any object that is a semigroup.
%prp(def:semigroup):abelian
prp:Abelian
    A semigroup $\mathcal G$ is abelian if and only if
    neq:
        \mathcal G \models \forall_{x}\forall_y x * y = y * x

// This < in the definition notation means that we tell the computer that a monoid is a semigroup. 
// The < means that the new object being defined is a subobject of the first one.
%def(<def:semigroup):monoid
def:Monoid
    A monoid $\mathcal M = (M,*,1)$ is a semigroup $\mathcal G = (M,*)$ with an identity element $1 \in M$ such that 
    neq:
        \mathcal M \models \forall_{m} 1*m = m*1 = m
      


%def(<def:monoid):group
def:group structure
    A group $\mathcal G = (G,*,1, (\cdot)^{-1})$ is a monoid $\mathcal M = (G,1,*)$ with an inverse function $(\cdot)^{-1}$ satisfying:
    neq:
        \mathcal G \models \forall_x x * (x)^{-1} = (x)^{-1} * x = 1 

%res(def:group):unique inverse
res:Unique Invese
    If $\mathcal G$ is a group and $x \in G$, then $x$ has a unique inverse element.

    proof:
        Let $y,z$ be inverses of $x$. Then:
        neq:
            yxz = y(xz)=y
            
            yxz = (yx)z=z

        So $y=z$, and thus inverses are unique.



%def(def:semigroup):order
def:order
    The order of a semigroup $\mathcal G = (G,*)$ is simply $|G|$, the cardinality of it's domain.



%def(<def:group):subgroup
def:subgroup
    Given $H \subseteq G$, where $\mathcal G = (G,*,1,(\cdot)^{-1})$ is a group, 
    we say $\mathcal H = (H,*,1,(\cdot)^{-1})$ is a subgroup of $\mathcal G$ if it is a substructure.

// Here we put subgroup because it is an equivalent condition to the definition of a subgroup.
%res(def:subgroup):subgroup
res:Equivalent subgroup characterization
    If $H$ is a nonempty subset of the domain of a group $\mathcal G$, then $\mathcal H \le \mathcal G$ iff 
    neq:
        \forall_{x,y \in H} xy^{-1}\in H


%res(def:subgroup):intersection of subgroups
res:Intersection of subgroups is a group
    Let $\{H_{a}\}_a$ be a collection of subgroups of $\mathcal G$. Then 
    neq:
        (\bigcap_{a} H_a,*,1,(\cdot)^{-1}) \le $\mathcal G$ 

    proof:
        Note we just need to apply \ref{res:subgroup}, which yields that $H = \bigcap_{a}H_a$ is closed under $*$, 
        and since groups have a universal axiomatization, $(H,*,1,(\cdot)^{-1}) is a group.

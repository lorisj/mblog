%intro
    This note covers basic definitions and results of category theory. It mostly follows \cite{riehl_2016}, but also contains notes from \cite{simmons_2011},
    as well as special topics from \cite{nourani_2014}.


%def:category
    def:Category
        A category $C$ consists of
        
        %def:object
        -) A class $\ob(C)$ consisting of objects


        -) 
            A class $\hom(M)$ of morphisms.
            %//Because def:Morphism is in def:Category, replace def:morphism with def(def:category):morphism
            %def:morphism
                def:Morphism
                    A morphism is any object that has a source object $A \in \ob(C)$ and a target $B \in \ob(C)$. Morphisms are sometimes called arrows. 
                    
                    If $f$ is a morphism with source $A \in \ob(C)$ and target $B \in \ob(C)$, then this is usually written as $f:A \to B$. 
                    
                
        -) 
            A binary operation $\cdot : M \to M$, called composition, which satisfies:
            1) 
                $\cdot$ is associative
            
            2) 
                %// Note we are in the context def:category, so we don't need to write def(def:category):morphism 
                %def(def:morphism):identity morphism    
                    For every object $A \in \ob(C)$, there exists an identity morphism $1_A : A \to A$, such that for every morphism $f:A \to B$:
                        neq:
                            f \circ 1_A = f = 1_B \circ f

        -) $\cat{Set}$ has objects consisting of all sets, and morphisms consisting of all functions between sets.
        -) $\cat{Top}$ has objects consisting of all topological spaces, and morphisms consisting of all continuous functions between these spaces.
        -) $\cat{Group}$ has objects consistig of all groups, and morphisms consisting of all homomorphisms between groups.
        -) 
            For a fixed ring $R$ (with identity), $cat{Mod}_R$ is the category of left $R$-modules and $R$-module homomorphisms.
            If $R$ is a field, then we call this   
        -) $\cat{Graph}$ has objects consisting of all graphs, and morphisms consisting of graph homomorphisms.
        -) 
            For any language $\mathcal L$ and first order $\mathcal L$-theory $T$, there is a category $\cat{Model}_T$ with objects as 
            $[\mathcal L, T]$-structures (i.e. $\mathcal L$-structures $\mathcal M$ that model $T$, so $\mathcal M \models T$).


%res(def(def:category):morphism):unique identity
    res:Unique identity
        Identity morphisms in a category are unique.

        proof:
            Consider an object $A$ with two identity morphisms $f, g : A \to A$. Then note $f = f \circ g = g$. 


%def(def(def:category):morphism):hom-class
    def:Hom-class
        Let $C$ be a category. Let $A,B \in ob(C)$ be two objects. Denote $C(A,B) = \{ f \in \hom(C)  |  f : A \to B\}$, 
        i.e. the class containing all morphisms with source $A$ and target $B$. This is called the Hom-class, and is sometimes written as $\Hom(A,B)$.
        
%def(def(def:category):morphism):isomorphism
    def:Isomorphism
        A morphism $f:X\to Y$ is an isomorphism if and only if it is invertible, i.e there exists some $g:Y \to X$ such that
        neq:
            gf = 1_X

            fg = 1_Y
        
        We then say two objects $X,Y$ are isomorphic.
        
%def(def(category):morphism):endomorphism
    def:Endomorphism
        An endomorphism is a morphism whose domain is the same as the codomain, i.e. $f:X \to X$ is an endomorphism.

%def(def:isomorphism, def:endomorphism):automorphism
    def:automorphism
        A automorphism is a morphism which is both an isomorphism and an endomorphism.

        -)

Note that morphisms are technically binary relations, (if they arent a set then they can be though of as a relation of a class) 
but this sometimes is not the right way of looking at them.
This is true in the following example: 
%exp(def:category):abstract category examples
    exp:
        1)
            For any ring $R$, define the category $C=\cat{Mat}_R$:
            -) $\ob(C) = \Z_+$
            -) Define $\hom(C)$ as the set of $C(n,m)= R^{n \times m}$, i.e. all $n$ by $m$ matrices.
            -) $\cdot$ is defined as matrix multiplication

            To check this forms a category, note that:
            
            -) $\cdot$ is associative because matrix multiplication is associative
            -) 
                Every object has an identity, namely for any $n \in \ob(C)$ there is the $n\times n$ identity matrix $I_n$, which has the property that
                for any morphism $f:m \to n$ (i.e. for every $n \times m$ matrix) we have $I_n \circ f = f \circ I_m = f$.
            
            
            Thus $C$ is a category. 
            
            Note that while technically $\hom(C)$ consists of relations, (i.e. you have a relation for each $n\times m$ matrix)
            it is not productive to think of morphisms this way, so you should rather think of morphisms as some new object, i.e. an arrow.
        2)
            For any monoid $\mathcal M = (M,*)$, define the category $C=\cat{B}_M$:
            -) $\ob(C)$ consists of some single object (could be anything, let's call it $☺$)
            -) For every monoid element $m \in M$, define a morphism $f_{m}: ☺ \to ☺$.
            -) Define $\cdot$ as the binary operation $f_m \cdot f_n \mapsto f_{m * n}$.

            Note that monoids have identity elements and associative binary operation,
